                <p>' When was the last time you spent a quiet moment just doing nothing -
                 just sitting and looking at the sea, or watching the wind blowing the tree limbs,
                  or waves rippling on a pond, a flickering candle or children playing in the park? '

                <p>' While on top of Everest, I looked across the valley towards the great peak Makalu and mentally
                 worked out a route about how it could be climbed. It showed me that even though I was standing on 
                 top of the world, it wasn't the end of everything. I was still looking beyond to other interesting 
                 challenges. '

                     you don't climb mountains without being prepared and you don't climb mountains without
                      balancing the risks and rewards. And you never climb a mountain on accident - 
                      it has to be intentional '
